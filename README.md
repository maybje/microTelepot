# microTelepot
MicroPython implementation of Telepot

- It creates a csv file called "last_update_id.csv", where the last update id from the Telegram bot is saved. It is originally saved at the root directory of the micro controller.
- Haven't tried it in circuit python. But I suspect it would run smoothly.

### Usage:
- All you need to do is to instatiate the class with the bot ID provided by Telegram.
- It assumes you are already connected to the internet.
